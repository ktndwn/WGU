        <h3>PURPOSE</h3>
        <div class="maincontent">
            <div class="pdfbox">
                <h4>Since my course is designed around the basics of multimedia concepts, the exposure triangle concept was chosen to be showcased since it is a fundamental part of photography and videography for students to understand in order to learn how to identify and physically take  better photos or videos. The video created was to present an overview of the exposure triangle concept in a 2-3 minute video covering the essentials of each element which breaks down into the aperture, the shutter speed, and the ISO.</h4>

        <h3>AUDIENCE</h3>
        <div class="maincontent">
            <div class="pdfbox">
                <h4>Based on the needs analysis, the members of the Marketing department within the Company struggle with basic multimedia tasks associated with their respective roles. These tasks include image resizing, adding transparency, the inability to contribute to photo and video shoots, etc. These basic tasks are constantly being handed off to a small number of specialists which consume time and limit efficiency for everyone involved. The current instruction is focused on teaching the basics of multimedia concepts to Company team members, specifically to employees of the Marketing department using a learning management system and the website in relation to this task. These multimedia concepts are broken down into eight subcategories teaching photo/video concepts, composition techniques, DSLR related hardware, photo manipulation, video editing, image filetypes/video encoding, audio hardware and finally audio mixing. The exposure triangle is a mandatory element of the photo/video concepts subcategory and would help allow learners to work independently when taking their pictures or video.</h4>

        <h3>CREATION AND PROCESS</h3>
        <div class="maincontent">
            <div class="pdfbox">
                <h4>The creation process of the video is very technical to someone not versed in the field of multimedia and utilized 4-5 different software working in conjunction to contribute to the final product. This outline will go over a generalized understanding of the process and all image examples used are cited below.</h4>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="maincontent">
            <div class="pdfbox">
                <h4>After the script was finalized, the first piece of software used was a program called Audacity which is an open-source audio editing program that has a very straight-forward and expanded approach to inputs and output for audio hardware and was used to record the voice over. The audio file was then brought into Adobe Audition for editing, level balancing, and noise removal and allows for a full cleanup of the audio without destroying the underlying frequencies that our ears are accustomed to with normal speech. Audacity has similar tools for this process, but it isn’t nearly as powerful as Adobe Audition for sound mixing. Once the audio file was finalized, the visual portion was then started and for this Adobe After Effects was the driving force. After Effects is a very powerful, industry-standard, 2D motion graphics tool that has numerous strengths in compositing and a full suite of animation tools at hand. Knowledge of layering and keyframe animation are mandatory when using this software. Based on the script written previously, the video was divided into four categories, an overview, the aperture, shutter speed, and ISO. Graphics were edited as needed using Adobe Photoshop and example photos were gathered and stored into the necessary project file locations. The audio was the first element to be placed in After Effects and was utilized as a stepping stone for the animation process within the video. The editing was then systematically driven by following the audio and presenting the graphics as necessary. Now that the actual editing process was over, how do we get the video out of After Effects? This is where Adobe Media Encoder comes in. Video encoding is another complicated niche that requires knowledge of resolutions, codecs, frame rates, and current trends of the industry. The file was exported using the H.264 codec at 10mbps, 720p and 60fps to match the composition, the audio was encoded at 256kbps which is double that of web standards, but audio size compared to video size is negligible. The 2-3 minute that was churned out took thirty seconds to create, was 8.7mbps and about 200mb in size, much too large for streaming for something so small in length. Uploading to Youtube presents a few issues to video preservation as Youtube converts videos to Google’s own VP9 codec which optimizes the video for streaming at the cost of proper details. It’s the main reason pixelation occurs at the start of most of their videos even with proper bandwidth. Quality is key for the preservation of finer details so Youtube was skipped as a solution to a smaller size. Vimeo just re-encodes their files into H.264, but has limits on the amount of high definition videos that can be converted in a given time frame without paid incentives. At this point, the decision was made to reduce the video size personally and use the Github managed website to host the video directly. Github limits their file size uploads to 25mb so we have to reduce to video down to be 25mb at maximum. Video bitrate would have to be downgraded to achieve this so Handbrake was the software utilized to downgrade the video. Handbrake is another open source software used to encode video using the H.264 codec, but what sets Handbrake apart is the finer control with encoding settings compared to Adobe Media Encoder. With Handbrake, time can be set as a variable to encode a video and have the CPU take however long you need to process and compress resulting in a smaller, but highly detailed video. Media Encoder has no such controls for that, but is tied into the Adobe Creative Cloud software “ecosystem”. After fine tuning and fifteen minutes of encoding, Handbrake’s version of the video was 1mbps and 24mb in size with no noticeable difference in quality compared to the larger version. As a final step, the video file was then added to the HTML of the website and appropriately uploaded to Github.</h4>

        <h3>CONCEPT FRAMEWORK DISCUSSION</h3>
        <div class="maincontent">
            <div class="pdfbox">
                <h4>As stated above, the exposure triangle concept was chosen because it is relevant to the first subcategory for learners to begin their journey. The hand-drawn image was used as the personal graphics option in Task 2 and also the basis for the structure of the video lesson with additional details added. Taking the three elements, I created four categories for the video with a quick fade-to-black as transitions:</h4>

                <h4>A general overview that also serves as an introduction to explain why the concept is important. The aperture element, how it affects a scene, how it’s measured, what happens when you go in one direction versus another and two examples showing opposing settings.

                    <br>
                    The shutter speed element, the main effect it has on a picture, how the timing relates to the light and two opposing examples to clearly define the element in action.

                    <br>
                    The ISO, how sensitivity to light effects a picture, when do you use it (or more importantly, why you shouldn’t) and two examples showcasing the different settings of ISO.</h4>
